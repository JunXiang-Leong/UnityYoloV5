# UnityYoloV5
A simple example of unity barracuda with yolov5

Some Notes:
- if you want to use your own model make sure that the gameobject "background" matches the image input size (some legacy code written by the original owner that I'm too lazy to fix)
- don't forget to change any fields regarding image size to match your model input.
